    <h2 id="digital-overuse">What is Digital Overuse</h2>
    <p>Digital overuse, often referred to as digital overload, describes the excessive engagement with digital devices and platforms—such as smartphones, computers, and social media—that negatively impacts an individual's mental, emotional, and physical well-being. In our technology-driven society, the omnipresence of digital media has made it increasingly challenging to disconnect, leading to various adverse effects.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 id="attachment">Why Do People Get Attached to Digital Devices?</h2>
    <h2>Common Reason</h2>
    <p>One of the most common reasons people get attached to their digital devices is mindless scrolling — or scrolling nonstop without realizing they’ve been doing it for an hour or more.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 id="mindless-scrolling">What is mindless Scrolling?</h2>
    <p>Mindless scrolling or zombie scrolling syndrome refers to the compulsive habit of scrolling through social media or news feeds, which can negatively impact mental health by contributing to anxiety, depression, and difficulty focusing. It can also distort our thoughts, leading to feelings of loneliness without a clear reason or worrying about problems that don’t actually exist. </p>
    <br>
    <h1 id="steps">How to Stop Digital Overuse?</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Step 1: Dilemma</h2>
    <p>The first step is awareness. You need to recognize that you’ve become too attached to your devices. Ask yourself: Do you want to be productive and live a fulfilling life, or stay stuck chasing a fake reality? Awakening is crucial — you must wake up and convince yourself to change. Stop letting temporary distractions dictate your life.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Diversion</h2>
    <p>Manage your time intentionally. Limit your use of digital devices to 5–10% of your day. Prioritize meaningful activities and create a balanced schedule. Step outside, get some sunlight, and refresh your mind. Real-life experiences will help you regain control and improve your mood.</p>
    <h2>Step 3: Discover</h2>
    <p>Boredom fuels mindless scrolling. Fill that gap with meaningful hobbies. Try physical activities like jogging, swimming, or yoga to boost your energy. Explore creative outlets like painting, writing, or music. Develop practical skills like cooking, programming, or learning a new language. Join a club or volunteer to build real connections. Life is meant to be experienced — find what excites you and grow from it.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 4: Diagram</h2>
    <p>Create a realistic and achievable plan. Our website provides a structured to-do list to help you organize your day. Break down big goals into smaller, manageable tasks to maintain motivation and satisfaction. Completing daily goals will give you a sense of accomplishment. Don’t forget to reward yourself for your progress — you’ve earned it.</p>
    <h2>Step 5: Discipline</h2>
    <p>Consistency is key. Motivation will get you started, but discipline will keep you going. Even on bad days, show up and stick to your plan. Success isn’t about feeling motivated every day — it’s about showing up and putting in the work, no matter how you feel.</p>
    <h2>Step 6: Digest</h2>
    <p>Absorb and apply these steps. This framework is designed to help you break free from digital addiction and reclaim your life. Anxiety and emptiness from overusing devices will fade as you build a balanced, intentional lifestyle.</p>
